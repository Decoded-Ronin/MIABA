# MIABA (Mail-in-a-Box Admin)

MIABA (Mail-in-a-Box Admin) is a simple, efficient, and user-friendly mobile application 
for administrators managing a Mail-in-a-Box server. This app allows you to easily manage 
user accounts and email aliases on your server. Currently in pre-release, MIABA is available 
for testing, and I welcome feedback to help improve future releases.

## Key Features:

- Remove Users: Easily remove user accounts from the server when they're no longer needed.
- Edit User Information: Modify user privileges and change password.
- Manage Aliases: Add, remove, and update email aliases, providing flexibility in routing emails for different purposes.
- Simplified UI: A clean, intuitive interface that makes managing your server easier and more efficient.
